# AI Integration Deployment Guide

## Problem Solved
The AI integration works locally but not on production server (https://retsary.adsolutions-eg.com/) because environment variables are not configured on the production server.

## Solution Applied
Updated `apphosting.yaml` to include the Google AI API key as an environment variable for Firebase App Hosting.

## Files Modified
1. `apphosting.yaml` - Added environment variable configuration
2. `src/ai/genkit.ts` - Updated model to use `gemini-1.5-flash`
3. `src/ai/flows/analyze-performance-flow.ts` - Replaced mock with actual AI calls

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Firebase App Hosting
```bash
# Make sure you're in the studio directory
cd studio

# Deploy the updated configuration
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### 2. Alternative: Redeploy the entire app
```bash
# If you need to redeploy everything
firebase deploy
```

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
After deployment, the production server will have access to:
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: AIzaSyDtvc0zhvS-IhU5q_ibrfK0GeDg7DLPeug

## Testing After Deployment
1. Visit https://retsary.adsolutions-eg.com/
2. Log in to the dashboard
3. Click "ØªØ­Ù„ÙŠÙ„ Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø¯Ø§Ø¡ Ø¨Ø§Ù„Ø°ÙƒØ§Ø¡ Ø§Ù„Ø§ØµØ·Ù†Ø§Ø¹ÙŠ" (AI Performance Analysis)
4. Verify that AI analysis works and returns Arabic financial insights

## Security Note
The API key is now included in the deployment configuration. For enhanced security in production, consider:
1. Using Firebase Functions to proxy AI requests
2. Implementing API key rotation
3. Adding request rate limiting

## Troubleshooting
If AI still doesn't work after deployment:
1. Check Firebase Console logs for errors
2. Verify the API key is correctly set in Firebase App Hosting environment
3. Ensure the Genkit dependencies are properly installed in production

## Current AI Integration Status
